The goal of this program is to group files that are in the same check-in and find correlations.

/**
     *   The goal of this program is to find correlations between files based on a specific feature or bug fixes.
     *   It's not to find dependencies between files or a runtime call graph.
     *   The idea is that for any given feature a group of files will be touched and based on
     *   this to find the most common groupings.  For example, if a change is made to a given 
     *   file A, there is a strong correlation that changes will be made in C, D, and E.
